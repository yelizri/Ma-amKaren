        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>I like this hobby because it's an outlet for me against the stress in pisay. It makes me feel free and let go of things. The principles are pretty simple and I think I've been improving. I started the playing UD in grade 7 because <br> 1. My friends played it <br> 2. There was no one in our batch's UD team <br> I'm pretty sure the 2nd reason is why we all started playing it, but today, we have a full team with a lot of subs. I think I've also influenced my friends somehow to countinue playing, and the team is like one big friendgroup since we all just influence our friends to play. The team is also really fun, and I've gotten close with a lot of them.</p>
